# RegExHelper
A UI to help with writing Regular Expressions.

This is a UI built using PowerShell and WPF that allows for simple Regular Expression checking by displaying the results in real time.

Currently this only supports a string match but future versions will allow for locating patterns in a log file or similiar groups of text.
